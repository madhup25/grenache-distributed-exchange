/* Requirements:
    1. Each client will have its own instance of the orderbook which contains a list of orders, i.e., buy and sell.
    2. Clients submit orders to their own instance of orderbook. The order is distributed to other instances, too.
    3. If a clientâ€™s order matches with another order, any remainder is added to the orderbook, too.
*/

/* Orderbook class:
    - orderbook: Array of orders
    - addOrder(): Function to add a order to the orderbook
    - distributeOrder(): Function to distribute order to other nodes
    - getOrderbook(): Function to get orderbook
    - setOrderbook(): Function to set orderbook
